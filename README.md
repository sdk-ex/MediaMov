# Welcome to the `MediaMov` Repository!

**What is `MediaMov`:**

### Video Downloader
 
 Indeed, the add-on `MediaMov` is intended as a downloader right in the browser     
 designed to help download whatever video content is present on the page.       
 For added context, this came about as an idea for a desktop app written in `Java`,     
 which would do the exact same thing.

 Instead of being an add-on with minimal UI and controls, this application would     
 be capable of even installing an entire channels content! This program is designed         
 in JavaScript, specifically using Electron. For a more in depth look at the stack,    
 check for the corresponding documentation. Overall this program did not end up being   
 very large or in depth, therefore the docs will only consists of a few more Markdown    
 files with light specifications.

 This includes the reason why this program ended up being a JavaScript creation rather    
 than being straight Java. There is of course, so many downsides to using this platform      
 compared to using JavaFX.
