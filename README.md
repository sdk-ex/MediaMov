# Welcome to the `MediaMov` Repository!

**What is `MediaMov`:**

### Video Downloader
 
 Indeed, the add-on `MediaMov` is intended as a downloader right in the browser     
 designed to help download whatever video content is present on the page.       
 For added context, this came about as an idea for a desktop app written in `Java`,     
 which would do the exact same thing.        
 
 <br/>
 
 Instead of being an add-on with minimal UI and controls, this application would     
 be capable of even installing an entire channels content! But with the fast changes    
 made to the YouTube (our intended target) and the lack of major support in general for      
 the `Java` language (its not the worst, but not the best either), on top of our constant     
 use of `JavaScript` for a whole plethora of other things, it just made sense to make a      
 small extension style app to get the job done in the meantime.       

 <br/>

 Who knows, it might even be better! That is the full context of how this came about,      
 further info will be provided as the app is pushed further along in development.
